/**
 * Versioned, forward-only SQLite migration runner.
 *
 * Applied migrations are recorded in a `schema_migrations` bookkeeping table so
 * re-running the runner is a no-op.  Each migration is applied inside its own
 * transaction together with the bookkeeping INSERT: if the SQL fails the whole
 * unit rolls back and no later migration is attempted.
 *
 * This module is the execution engine. Reading and writing the bookkeeping
 * table is {@link MigrationTracker}'s job, kept in `./tracker`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const runner = new MigrationRunner(db, loadMigrations(dir));
 * runner.up(); // applies 0001, 0002, ...; a second call applies nothing
 * ```
