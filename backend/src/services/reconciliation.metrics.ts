/**
 * Reconciliation drift metrics (issue #496).
 *
 * Two counter families are maintained, both labelled by {@link DriftType}:
 *
 * • `reconcile.driftDetected{type}` — how often a drift category was observed.
 * • `reconcile.remediated{type}`   — how often a drift category was actually
 *   repaired (as opposed to merely reported).
 *
 * The difference between the two is the operational signal: a growing gap means
 * drift is being detected but not acted upon, which is the condition that leads
 * to stranded escrows.
 *
 * A tiny process-local registry is all this needs: the counters are reset on
 * restart by design (they are rates and ratios, not a ledger), and the durable
 * record of what happened lives in the reconciliation report and the
 * `reconcile_pending_drift` table.
